## Final Project 



The House prices data set from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) competition 80 variables for training set and 81 for testing set of possible sales made in Ames, Iowa. . 

The house prices data set has some missing values and we are going to replace them with zero.

## Probaility

Lets Calculate as a minimum the below probabilities a through c.  Assume the small letter "x" is estimated as the 3d quartile of the X variable, and the small letter "y" is estimated as the 2d quartile of the Y variable.  Interpret the meaning of all probabilities.  In addition, make a table of counts as shown below.
a.	$ P(X>x | Y>y)$		b. $ P(X>x, Y>y)$		c. $ P(X<x | Y>y)	$



```{r}
# Calculate the 2nd quartile of X and Y
x_quartile2 <- quantile(X, probs = 0.50, na.rm = TRUE)
y_quartile2 <- quantile(Y, probs = 0.50, na.rm = TRUE)

# Calculate the 3rd quartile of X
x_quartile3 <- quantile(X, probs = 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)

# Categorize observations based on quartiles
x_leq_2d_quartile <- sum(X <= x_quartile2)
x_gt_2d_quartile <- sum(X > x_quartile2)
x_leq_3d_quartile <- sum(X <= x_quartile3)
x_gt_3d_quartile <- sum(X > x_quartile3)

# Calculate counts for each category
leq_2d_quartile_leq_3d_quartile <- sum(X <= x_quartile2 & Y <= y_quartile2)
leq_2d_quartile_gt_3d_quartile <- sum(X <= x_quartile2 & Y > y_quartile2)
gt_2d_quartile_leq_3d_quartile <- sum(X > x_quartile2 & Y <= y_quartile2)
gt_2d_quartile_gt_3d_quartile <- sum(X > x_quartile2 & Y > y_quartile2)

# Calculate totals
total_leq_3d_quartile <- x_leq_3d_quartile
total_gt_3d_quartile <- x_gt_3d_quartile
total_leq_2d_quartile <- sum(leq_2d_quartile_leq_3d_quartile, leq_2d_quartile_gt_3d_quartile)
total_gt_2d_quartile <- sum(gt_2d_quartile_leq_3d_quartile, gt_2d_quartile_gt_3d_quartile)
total <- total_leq_3d_quartile + total_gt_3d_quartile

# Fill out the table
table_counts <- matrix(c(
  leq_2d_quartile_leq_3d_quartile, leq_2d_quartile_gt_3d_quartile, total_leq_2d_quartile,
  gt_2d_quartile_leq_3d_quartile, gt_2d_quartile_gt_3d_quartile, total_gt_2d_quartile,

Definition 
**GrLivArea**: Above Ground Living Area, measured in square feet. It encompasses the living area that is not in the basement.

Properties with above ground living area that are inferior or equal to  3rd quartile and salesprices 2nd quartile (577 houses) represent houses that don't have a living basement. Those houses are placed in a more affordable area. 

Properties with above ground living area that are inferior or equal to  3rd quartile and salesprices 2nd quartile (154 houses)  are most likely to located in low price or average price Areas based on the detail information available in the data set.


Properties with above ground living area that are superior to  3rd quartile and salesprices 2nd quartile (155 houses) are most like to located in a upcoming neiborhoods where sale prices are increasing. 


Properties with above ground living area that are superior to  3rd quartile and salesprices 2nd quartile (574 houses) are most like to
the most expensive area to live in because they offer more living space and they are not counted toward the house measurements.

Chi-Square shows that there is a strong relationship existed between **GrLivArea and SalesPrice**. The Chi Square yield a value of 483.29  and p-value that is approximately equal to 4.118547e-107 which less than p-value < 2.2e-16. We reject the null hypothesis.

The univariate plots show us how the data from X and Y are distributed and presence of outlines . The scatterplot visualize the relationships between the the variables of X and Y. the correlation matrix shows a strong relationship among the variables with correlation of 0.70.

The hypothesis test show there is strong relationship among the variables. we re 99% confident that the true correlation coefficient lie with our range.

The Scree Plot represent the eigen values obtained by the Principal component Analysis. The biplot shows the relationships between the original variables (X and Y) and the principal components. The direction and length of the arrows represent the strength and direction of the relationship between the variables and the principal components.

For Principal Component 1 (PC1):

We have Standard deviation 1.3071, Proportion of Variance of 0.8543 and a Cumulative Proportion of 0.8543. PCI has a high standard deviation which explain PC1 captures a significant amount of variability in the data set. PC1 could represent the primary factor influencing the observations in the data set. PC2 captures additional, less dominant patterns or trends in the data.

The exponential data is much more skewed. The simulated data is not a great fit. we need to use better techniques to improve the skewness. 


## Modeling 

we use correlation to pick up the most relevant features to predict Sale Price of a house. For every one-unit increase in Overall quality and finish of the house  (which is likely a rating of overall material and finish of the house), the Sale Price is estimated to increase by $18,566.79$, holding all other variables constant. House with garages that hold more than one cars and additional storage will increase by  $17,578.73$. the model did pretty good. we were able to achieve a R-squared value of 0.8128 suggests that approximately 81.3% of the variability in Sale Price is explained by the predictor variables included in the model. we see that over all quality of the house, the year the house was built and garage space have significant impacts on the Sale Price of the house. 


we discovers some outliers when plotting fitted and residual. we see random individual points that fall far from the main cluster of points which means that these outliers could represent observations that are poorly explained by the model or data points with unusual characteristics that require more investigations. 


we were able to acheive 0.67155 on kaggle. we are have to improve. you can use other evaluation techniques or use the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) analysis to to reduce the dimensionality of data while preserving as much variance as possible. it is also a technique that remove these outliers.

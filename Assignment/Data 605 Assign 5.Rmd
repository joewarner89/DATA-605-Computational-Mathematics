## Exercise 1 page 35
Let $\Omega$ be a sample space. Let $m(a) = 1=2, m(b) = 1=3 , m(c) = 1=6$. Find the probabilities for all eight subsets of $\Omega$

## Solution 


$\Omega$ is the space of:
$m(a) = \frac{1}{2}$
$m(b) = \frac{1}{3}$
$m(c) = \frac{1}{6}$

$P(\theta) = m(\theta) = 0$
$P(a) = m(a) = \frac{1}{2}$
$P(b) = m(b) = \frac{1}{3}$
$P(c) = m(c) = \frac{1}{6}$

The probabilities for each subst are: 
$P(a,b) = m(a) + m(b) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{6}$


$P(a,c) = m(a) + m(c) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3}$


$P(b,c) = m(b) + m(c) = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$


$P(a,b,c) = m(a) + m(b) + m(c)= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{6} = 1$



This is the probabilities for all subsets.
